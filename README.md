## Abstract Datatype
ADT is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

## Examples
List : Dynamic Array, Listed lists
Queue : Linked list, Based Queues, Array Based Queues, Stack Based Queue
Map : Tree Map, Hash Map, Hash Table
Vechicle : Golf Cart, Bicycle, Smart Car

## Complexity Analysis
How much time does an algorithm ned to finsh
How much space an algorithm needs for its computation

## Big-O Notation
Big O Notation gives an upper bound of complexity in the worst case helping to qualify performance as input size becomes arbitrarily large.

n - The size of the input complexities ordered in from smallest to largest
##### Constant Time : O(1)
##### Logarithmic Time: O(log(n))
##### Linear Time : O(n)
##### Linearithmic Time: O(nlog(n))
##### Quadric Time: O(n^2)
##### Cubic Time: O(n^3)
##### Exponential Time:O(b^n), b > 1
##### Factorial Time: O(n!)
